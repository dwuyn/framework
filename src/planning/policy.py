──────────────────────
Evidence-gated budget-aware action selection policy for VeriPlanPT.

The BudgetPolicy scores each candidate action by:

    score = w1 * P(success) + w2 * E(evidence_gain) - w3 * norm_cost - w4 * risk

Weights are loaded from policy.lock.json after 5-fold cross-validation on
the 40-case train split.  Before the file exists, equal weights are used.

Service rotation rules (hardcoded, not tunable):
  - Two consecutive failures that produce no new evidence on the same service
    force a rotation to the next service with remaining candidates.
  - No service may consume more than 50% of the remaining budget unless its
    confidence is >= 0.8 OR all other services have been exhausted.
